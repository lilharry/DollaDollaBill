Design Changes:

* Changed the listing schema:
      * Moved location to the same line as the username.
      * Placed date on the same line as the number of likes and comments
* Database table changes:
      * Image in images table is stored as text
      * Type is added to listings table to differentiate between products and services
* Although we allow more than one image to be uploaded, only the first image will be displayed.
* We also added options to remove listing (only for authors) and “unlike” the post.
